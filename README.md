# Transportation-Mode-Detection-TMD-
The project focused on Transportation Mode Detection (TMD) and involved the development of models for classifying transportation modes using a large dataset comprising 5.6 million rows. To effectively handle this extensive dataset, it was divided into time windows, allowing the extraction of features from continuous time series sequences.

The models were trained using various techniques, including shallow supervised machine learning algorithms like logistic regression. 
To further enhance the accuracy of the TMD classification, other advanced models were also trained, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 

The primary objective was to achieve the highest possible accuracy in classifying transportation modes by training these models on the dataset. It is essential to assess the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Such evaluations help determine the model that performs optimally and can be employed for accurate TMD classification.
